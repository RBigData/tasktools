Title: Tools for Task Parallelism with MPI
Version: 0.2-0
Description: Tools for task-based parallelism with MPI via 'pbdMPI'.
    Several utilities are provided, each with an apply-like interface. There is
    support for 'pre-scheduling' tasks as well as a "load-balancing" mode that
    farms them out from a central process. Finally, the functions support
    'checkpointing', which allows the task runs to be interrupted and restarted
    from their last completed task.
